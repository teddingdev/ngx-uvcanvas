	Triangle Grid Contouring
	------------------------

	Using a 2D simplex grid to construct the isolines of a 2D field function, namely
    gradient noise. I'm not entirely sure what to call the process. Since it's the
	triangular version of the marching squares algorithm, you'd think it'd be called
	"marching triangles," but that term is used to describe grid point cloud related
    triangulation. Therefore, "triangle grid contouring" will do. :)

	I've been coding up some Wang tile related patterns on square grids lately, which got
	me thinking about attempting the same on a triangle grid. Whilst doing that, I got
	sidetracked and wondered what contour lines created with the triangular equivalent of
	a marching squares algorithm would look like, and here we are. :)

    I put this together for novelty purposes, but I'd imagine there'd be some practical
	aspects associated with it; Vector contour point lists would be an obvious one, and
	to a lesser extent, triangulated height maps. However, rendering smooth curves would
	be one of the main benefits. Only one unique linear interpolant is rendered through
	each triangle, which means that Bezier point information via neighboring triangles
	with shared edges would be easy to obtain.... I might demonstrate that at a later
	date, but for now, a novel proof of concept will do.

// If you were rendering from a vertex shader, or just pushing out a triangle list
// in general, then you'd need to triangulate the triangles that have been split into
// quads. The process is almost trivial with just one contour, and slightly more
